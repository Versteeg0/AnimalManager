Premise of the asignment was to make a website in .NET Framework to get a feel of the possibilties of C#.
The hardest challenge we had in this was figurering out the structure of C# and how it works cohesively with javascript and html.
We battled the issues and bugs with reading through all the documentation on the Microsoft sites and school material available for us.
